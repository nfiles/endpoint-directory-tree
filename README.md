# Directory Tree

## Prerequisite - install `go`

1. download the `go` binary here: https://go.dev/doc/install
2. run the installer

## Run

Navigate to this directory in your favorite shell

To test with the sample input:
```bash
go run . < input.txt
```

To launch a REPL and provide your own commands:
```bash
go run .
# enter commands
# CTRL-C to exit
```

Cross-compiled binaries have been included in `bin/` if that's easier.
Only `bin/directorytree_linux_amd64` has been tested, so buyer beware. :)
```bash
bin/directorytree_linux_amd64 < input.txt
```
